## C Study

- About *[adivinhacao.c](https://github.com/dario-gms/C-Course/blob/main/adivinhacao.c) and [adivinhacao.out](https://github.com/dario-gms/C-Course/blob/main/adivinhacao.out)*.
> These files are from the knowledge obtained learning the first step of C (*C I*) in Alura's course. This is a guessing game in which the user chooses a level of difficulty and depending on the choice, will have a specific amount of attempts to win or lose. The project was all done in **C** and has basic programming logic elements, with elements like *if, else, for, while* and others.
